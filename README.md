# Meeting Notes AI

A local, privacy-focused AI meeting notetaker for Linux with a keyboard-driven TUI. Record meetings, transcribe with Whisper, and generate summaries with your choice of local or cloud LLM.

## Features

- **Keyboard-driven TUI** - Lazygit-inspired interface, no mouse required
- **Audio recording** - Mic + system audio (PipeWire/PulseAudio)
- **Local transcription** - OpenAI Whisper (CPU-based, privacy-first)
- **AI summaries** - Cloud AI (OpenAI, Anthropic, OpenRouter) or local (Ollama)
- **User notes** - Write your own notes during recording to provide context to AI
- **Markdown notes** - Full transcripts with timestamps
- **Note management** - Edit titles, manage tags, search, delete
- **Settings UI** - Configure AI providers, API keys, models, paths
- **Integrations** - Editor, file manager, clipboard, Waybar status

## Quick Start

### Automated Setup (Recommended)

The easiest way to get started:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/jamespember/meeting-notes.git
cd meeting-notes

# Run the setup script
./setup.sh
```

The setup script will:
1. Check system dependencies (ffmpeg, pulseaudio)
2. Create a Python virtual environment
3. Install all Python dependencies
4. Let you choose between Cloud AI, Local AI (Ollama), or no AI

### Manual Setup

If you prefer to set up manually:

#### 1. Install System Dependencies

```bash
# Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S python python-pip ffmpeg portaudio

# Ubuntu / Debian
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip python3-venv ffmpeg portaudio19-dev pulseaudio-utils

# Fedora / RHEL
# install rpm fusion
sudo dnf install https://download1.rpmfusion.org/free/fedora/rpmfusion-free-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm https://download1.rpmfusion.org/nonfree/fedora/rpmfusion-nonfree-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm

# install ffmpeg
sudo dnf swap ffmpeg-free ffmpeg --allowerasing

sudo dnf install python3 python3-pip python3-virtualenv pulseaudio-utils portaudio

# Your system should already have PipeWire/PulseAudio
```

#### 2. Set Up Python Environment

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Note:** The first time you run transcription, Whisper will download the `base` model (~140MB).

#### 3. Set Up AI Summarization

**Option A: Cloud AI (Recommended for speed and quality)**

Run the cloud setup script:
```bash
./setup_cloud.sh
```

Or configure manually:
- Press `,` in the app → configure API key
- Supports OpenAI, Anthropic, OpenRouter
- Keys stored in `~/.config/meeting-notes/config.yaml`

**Option B: Local AI (Free, private, but slower)**

Install Ollama:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
ollama pull llama3.2:3b
```

**Option C: No AI (transcription only)**

- Set `ai_provider: none` in settings
- You'll get transcripts without AI summaries

### Run the Application

```bash
# Activate virtual environment (if not already active)
source venv/bin/activate

# Run the application
python run.py

# Or with development mode (preserves temp audio files):
python run.py --dev
```

## Hyprland/Waybar Integration

### Waybar Status Module

Shows recording status in your Waybar (idle/recording/processing).

**1. Add module to Waybar config** (`~/.config/waybar/config.jsonc`):

```jsonc
{
  "modules-right": [
    "custom/meeting-notes",
    // ... your other modules
  ],

  "custom/meeting-notes": {
    "exec": "/path/to/meeting-notes/hyprland/waybar-module.sh",
    "return-type": "json",
    "interval": 5,
    "format": "{}",
    "on-click": "$HOME/.local/bin/meeting-notes",
    "tooltip": true
  }
}
```

**2. Add styles** (`~/.config/waybar/style.css`):

```css
#custom-meeting-notes.recording {
  color: #ff5555;
  font-weight: bold;
}

#custom-meeting-notes.processing {
  color: #f1fa8c;
}

#custom-meeting-notes.ready {
  color: #50fa7b;
}

#custom-meeting-notes.idle {
  color: #6272a4;
  opacity: 0.6;
}
```

**3. Reload Waybar:**

```bash
killall waybar && waybar &
```

The module shows:

- 󰗠 (gray) - App not running
- 󰗠 (green) - Ready
- 󰦕 05:42 (red) - Recording with timer
- 󰄬 (yellow) - Processing

### Keybinding

Add to `~/.config/hypr/hyprlandrc`:

```conf
bind = SUPER, M, exec, $HOME/.local/bin/meeting-notes
```

## Audio Configuration

Press `,` → **Audio** to configure all of this from the TUI.

**Recording modes:**
- `combined` - Mic + System (default, best for meetings)
- `mic` - Microphone only
- `system` - System audio only (records the default sink's monitor)

**Mic / System device pickers:**
The Audio settings page lists every PipeWire/PulseAudio source and sink
detected via `pactl`. Pick a specific one (e.g. *Scarlett Solo*) or leave
both on **System default** to follow whatever your OS is currently using.
Devices are stored by name (not numeric index), so they survive reboots.

**Whisper compute device:**
- `cpu` (default) — safe everywhere; matches the privacy-first claim above.
- `cuda` — uses your GPU; requires a working `torch` + CUDA install. If
  loading fails (e.g. *"no kernel image is available for execution on the
  device"*), the app automatically falls back to CPU and logs a warning.
- `auto` — let `torch` pick.

**Live mic level meter:**
While recording, the recording view shows a real-time peak meter for the
mic so you can confirm audio is actually arriving (green → yellow → red).
This runs as a separate `parec`/`pw-record` reader and doesn't interfere
with the main capture.

**Audio Test mode** (press `A` from the main view, or **Run Audio Test**
from settings → Audio):

- Shows live peak meters for both the mic and the system sink monitor
  simultaneously, so you can verify each side is wired up correctly.
- Records a 5-second clip with your *current* device choices (including
  unsaved changes in the settings screen) and then issues a verdict:
  - **PASS** — clip is the right length, levels are healthy, not clipping.
  - **WARN** — captured audio but it's too quiet, clipping, or mostly silent.
  - **FAIL** — file is missing/empty/silent; pipeline is broken.
- Lets you play the clip back through `pw-play`/`paplay`/`aplay`/`ffplay`
  so you can listen to what Whisper would actually see.
- Cleans up after itself: test recordings live in `/tmp` and are deleted
  when you close the screen.

### Does this work for Google Meet, Zoom, Teams, etc?

Yes. The system-audio capture path is app-agnostic — it records whatever's
playing through the configured sink. As long as your meeting app (browser
Meet, native Zoom, Teams, Slack huddle, Discord, etc.) plays through the
same sink the recorder is pointed at, the other participants' voices end
up in the transcript.

Three traps to watch for:

1. **Native apps remember per-app sinks.** Zoom, Teams etc. often
   remember the last "Speaker" you picked in their own settings. If you
   ever picked something other than "Same as System" / "System Default",
   Zoom may play out of laptop speakers while the recorder captures the
   Scarlett (or whatever).
2. **PipeWire `stream-restore` remembers per-app sinks.** Even browser
   tabs can stick to a sink they used last week.
3. **Echo-cancel virtual sources.** Some setups create an
   `echo-cancel-source` device. This only affects what your meeting
   partners hear from your mic; it doesn't affect what we capture for
   the transcript.

The Audio Test screen (press `A` from the main view) now actively
diagnoses all three. When a meeting app is running, it shows:

- `✓ Zoom is routed to the captured sink — its audio will be in your notes.`
- `⚠ Zoom is playing on 'alsa_output.builtin', but we'll capture 'alsa_output.scarlett'. Other participants' audio will be MISSING from your meeting notes.`

And during a real recording, if a meeting app opens a new stream on a
sink we're not capturing, you'll get a toast notification immediately.

### Why does the recorder use different tools for mic vs system audio?

`pw-record` (the PipeWire-native capture tool) handles microphone sources
correctly, but on at least one common setup — Focusrite Scarlett Solo
under PipeWire 1.6.4 — it captures sink monitors at roughly **40 dB lower
amplitude** than expected. `parec` (the PulseAudio compatibility tool)
reads the same monitor source at full level on the same hardware in the
same instant.

So the recorder uses:

- `parec` for any target ending in `.monitor` (system audio capture)
- `pw-record` for microphone sources

Both fall back to the other if the preferred tool is missing. This split
keeps mic capture on the simpler PipeWire-native path while routing
monitor capture through the compatibility shim that gets the volume
right.

If you discover your setup is the opposite (parec is quiet on monitors,
pw-record is loud), please open an issue with output from
`pactl list sinks | grep -A2 -E 'Name|Volume'` so we can revisit.
